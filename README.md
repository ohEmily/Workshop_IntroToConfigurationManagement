### 1. What is configuration management?
**Configuration management** systems allow you to speed up (_automation_), regulate (_version control_), and repeat (_idempotency*_) processes that go into  machine setup and configuration.

_(idempotency is a property that asserts that you can run the same set of commands more than once without breaking things.)
